<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run Flat Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting</li><li>Support Ring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-flat tire market is primarily categorized into two types: self-supporting and support ring systems. Self-supporting run-flat tires have reinforced sidewalls that maintain their shape even when deflated, allowing limited mobility without air pressure. In contrast, support ring systems utilize an additional ring inserted inside the tire to provide support during deflation, enabling the vehicle to continue driving. Both types enhance safety and convenience, particularly for emergency situations, by reducing the risk of tire blowouts and enabling continued travel.</p></p>
