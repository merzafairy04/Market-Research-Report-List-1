<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Antifouling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasound Antifouling System</li><li>Electrolytic Antifouling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine antifouling system market consists of two primary types: ultrasound antifouling systems and electrolytic antifouling systems. Ultrasound antifouling systems use ultrasonic waves to create vibrations that deter the attachment of marine organisms to submerged surfaces, reducing biofouling. In contrast, electrolytic antifouling systems utilize an electrochemical process to release biocides into the water, preventing fouling by harmful organisms. Both technologies aim to enhance vessel performance, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the lifespan of marine structures.</p></p>
